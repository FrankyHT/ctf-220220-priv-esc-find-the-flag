## Scenario
A system image belonging to an employee suspected of hiding accounting data relevant to a criminal investigation has been created by local law enforcement ICT staff for forensics investigation.

Limited ICT budget and support have resulted in the utilisation of legacy/ad-hoc software, resulting in outdated patches and ad-hoc/unconventional system control measures found on open-source platforms and knowledge bases.

Due to multiple users of the system, it is suspected that password security policy and management is not following best practice due to requirements for these systems to remain accessible to all involved personnel.

Digital Forensics First Responders have not attempted to access the system and have only found a sticky note attached to the physical system stating “account: user” on it.

## Task
You are to investigate the suspect system for any accounting data that may be used as evidence.
